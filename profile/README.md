Our company goal is to provide useful data and analytics to companies with powered and non-powered assets. Our solution stack includes:
1. A mobile app for tracking GPS and receiving dispatch requests
2. A secondary LoRa-based hardware to track GPS data powered by an OBD2 port.
3. A web-based dashboard to view assets and dispatch jobs to drivers.
